Disadvantages:
Limited ergonomics: Basic desk and chair setups may not provide optimal ergonomic support for all employees, potentially leading to discomfort or health issues over time.

Advantages:
Increased personalization: Allowing employees to customize their workspace can lead to increased job satisfaction and a sense of ownership. This can potentially boost morale and productivity.
Flexibility: A simple desk setup provides flexibility for employees to arrange their workspace according to their individual needs and preferences

New research shows that the way in which leaders communicate about competition can make employees experience either anxiety or excitement, and those feelings influence whether they react positively or negatively. When employees feel excited, they’re more likely to come up with creative solutions. When they feel anxious, they’re more likely to cu...

As a Moderator, I want to reject irrelevant or duplicate articles to maintain the quality of the SPEED database.

Given an article is in the moderation queue, When the Moderator identifies it as irrelevant or a duplicate, Then the system should allow the Moderator to reject the article and remove it from the queue.

Given an article is being reviewed by the Moderator, When the article is deemed irrelevant or a duplicate, Then the rejection should be based on predefined criteria, ensuring consistent quality control.

Given the Moderator has rejected an article, When the rejection action is confirmed, Then the system should flag the article as rejected and store it in a separate database or log for future reference.
